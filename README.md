# Extended-Villages-1.7.10
The source code for TheLarsinator's Extended Villages mod for Minecraft 1.7.10

This fork exists purely for me to see how custom village structure spawning works, and to figure out how to
do things like modify existing structure spawn templates so I'm not so annoyed by paths falling into oblivion and stuff
and the total lack of torches.

TheLarsinator deserves 100% credit for this mod.
